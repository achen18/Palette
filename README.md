## Firmware  
Macropad runs on KMK software.  
- Rotary encoder changes volume. Press to play/pause.
- 8 keys can be changed through KMK.
- Multiple layers for different day-to-day needs. Cycle between layers with a custom key!
- Custom OLED-dispalyed images to indicate current layer (working on images, using text as placeholder for now).
